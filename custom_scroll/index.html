        <p >A network is a system of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, and other hardware, that communicate with each other to share resources, information, and services. Networks enable connectivity across distances, allowing users and devices to collaborate and access data efficiently.

            <h2>Key Components of a Network:</h2>
            <h3>Device:</h3>
             <li>Nodes: Computers, smartphones, printers, or any device connected to the network.</li>
             <li>Servers: Provide resources or services, such as files, applications, or websites.</li>

            <h3>Communication Media:</h3>
            <li>Wired: Uses cables (e.g., Ethernet) for physical connections.</li>
            <li>Wireless: Utilizes radio waves or infrared (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).</li>
             
            <h3>Protocols:</h3>
             <li>Rules that define how data is transmitted. Examples include TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP.
            </li>
            <h3>Network Interface:</h3>
               <li>Devices use a network interface card (NIC) or wireless adapter to connect.
            </li>

            <h3>Topology:</h3>
            <li>Physical or logical arrangement of devices in the network (e.g., star, ring, or mesh).</li>

            <h2>Types of Networks:</h2>
         <h3>Local Area Network (LAN):</h3>
                <li>Covers a small geographical area, such as an office or home.</li>
            <h3>Wide Area Network (WAN):</h3>
                <li>Spans larger areas, like cities or countries. The internet is the largest WAN.
                </li>
            <h3>Metropolitan Area Network (MAN):</h3>
                <li>Connects multiple LANs within a city.</li>
            <h3>Personal Area Network (PAN):</h3>
                       <li>Limited to a person's immediate vicinity, using devices like Bluetooth.</li>
            <h3>Virtual Private Network (VPN):</h3>
                  <li>Creates a secure connection over a public network.</li>
